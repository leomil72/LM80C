---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following file reports the changelog of the LM80C firmware developed by Leonardo Miliani
for the LM80C Color Computer. More info at www DOT leonardomiliani DOT com

P.S.: for the changelog of the LM80C 64K Color Computer see the corresponding changelog file

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.19    - 20210119

- Better serial management with RTS-driven chars receiveing

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.18    - 20210105

- New behaviour for backspace (DEL) key: now chars that follow the cursor are moved 1 position
  to the left while deleting the char immediately before the current cursor position
- New behaviour for INSERT key: now it inserts a SPACE char (ASCII 32) so that the space 
  inserted is seen as part of the current line (in the past, the NULL char [ASCII 0] was used)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.17    - 20210104

- Changed the special key to disable the I/O DOS buffer, now it's CTRL - AT THE MOMENT,
  DISABLED BY DEFAULT INTO CODE
- Unified the source files between 32K and 64K versions thanks to the support for compiler's
  directives of the SJASMPlus assembler

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.16    - 20210101

- Code revision to comply with the assembler SJASMPLUS
- Moved equates for BASIC workspace area into a separated file
- Serial buffer overrun revision
- Fixed a bug into the serial code: the incoming chars were print on screen even if the
  cursor was off (i.e., in indirect mode)
- Added key auto-repeat
- Added support for INSERT key to insert a space between text by moving the chars after the
  cursor position
- LIST now manage ending line number correctly, so that it won't list the line after the
  one passed as argument anymore
- BASIC support for serial channel B
- Preliminary support for external mass storage (stubs for ERASE, FILES, LOAD, SAVE commands)
- Mechanism to enable/disable the 512-byte buffer for mass storage I/O operations (by
  pressing SHIFT while logo is shown on startup) - AT THE MOMENT, DISABLED BY DEFAULT INTO CODE

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.15    - 20201121

- New title text;
- Added ELSE statement to expand IF..THEN evaluation instruction, to execute one or more
  statements if the condition is false;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.14    - 20201020

- New graphic command PAINT to fill connected areas of the screen with a specific color
- Now POINT returns the color of the pixel being tested

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.13.8  - 20201001

- Fixed a little bug in COLOR statement: it didn't store the foreground color set by the
  user
- Now PLOT, CIRCLE, and DRAW statements accept color "0" to draw pixels with background
  color, i.e. reset pixels that are on
- Code cleaning

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.13.7  - 20200911

- Fixed a bug into the new cursor management routine: now the cursor won't appear during
  PRINTing anymore
- Fixed a bug into the comma tabulation: now the max. allowed number of columns is 
  calculated dinamically, according to the screen width

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.13.6  - 20200910

- Changed the cursor management routine: now the cursor is visible when being moved
- Now when the computer is software reset, the NMI is disabled before restart
- Tab printing with comma now reduced to 10 spaces

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.13.5  - 20200829

- Minor code revisions into BASIC interpreter
- Fixed a bug into the comma-separated printing code that lead to wrong alignment of the text

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.13.4  - 20200704

- Fixed a bug into the drawing line algorithm that crashed the system when there was a gap
  of 1 pixel between the starting and ending points;
- redefined chars 105,106, and 252 in 6x8

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.13.3  - 20200613

- Fixed a bug with function keys that lead to get a syntax error or a non-function behaviour
  when pressed them while system was in direct mode and print-on-screen not active, i.e.
  in a graphics mode 2 & 3.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.13.2  - 20200611

- Revised code of GPRINT command to avoid an error that emerged when the statement was called
  with an arguments line too long.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.13.1  - 20200607

- Fixed a race condition that could lead the interrupt service routine access the PSG reg #7
  (mixer) together with some BASIC statements (i.e., SOUND), resulting in wrong values being
  stored into the mixer.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.13  - 20200530

- New style for "Â£" char;
- fixed a bug into the automatic shutting down manager of SOUND that didn't de-activate the
  audio channel into the PSG mixer after a tone had finished its period of reproduction;
- new INSTR statement, returning the position of the first occurrence of one string within
  another;
- changed the behavior of INKEY statement: now the minimum delay interval is set to 10
  hundredths of a second. If a shorter interval is being passed, it will be automatically
  set to 10 (this is because values under 10 could lead to faulty readings).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.12  - 20200523

- Fixed a severe bug originated by a wrong design error of the final PCB: ports A & B of the
  PSG were inverted into the schematic, same for the definition of the ports into the code.
- Fixed a bug into the SOUND statement that accepted the third argument when generating a
  noise, even the syntax shouldn't accept it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.11  - 20200512

- Changed the way TMR() reads the real time counter so that now continue readings won't
  slow down the clock itself anymore;
- Changed the frequency of the keyboard reading. This task is now done every 1/50th of a second
  instead of each time the CTC channel 3 interrupt is raised: this lightens the "weight" of
  the interrupt service routine.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.10  - 20200508

- Added GPRINT command to print text and ASCII chars in screen 2 as they would in text modes;
- fixed a bug that lead to unpredictable behaviors when a line longer than 88 chars was
  received from the serial port: now the interpeter simply drops exceeding chars.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.9   - 20200502

- Added POINT function to get the status of a pixel in G2 mode (set or reset)
- Relocated CTC interrupt vectors to a jump table into RAM so that now the user can configure
  the CTC channel interrupts to jump to custom routines (included the routine attached to
  channel 3 that supervises several critical system routines);
- now SERIAL has default arguments for data, parity, and stop bits if not passed;
- changed FN key 5 function;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.8   - 20200430

- Fixed a bug in FN key codes that lead to the activation of the wrong FN keys;
- introduced support for NMI custom routines (suggested by nippur72) with NMI statement;
- fixed a bug that lead to un-wanted behaviors when graphic chars were parsed in direct mode;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.7   - 20200429

- Added HELP command to automatically list the line where a program error has occurred;
- added modulo operator '%' to make modulus operations between integers (returns the remainder
  of an integer division);
- added integer division operator '#' (return the integer part of a division);
- added support for function keys into firmware;
- added KEY command to manage function keys: it is now possible to print the current functions
  and assign new functions to the keys;
- revised PAUSE code: it is now possible to break the delay with the "RUN STOP" key;
- better error management when in graphic modes: now if an error occurs in G2 and G3
  modes, the BASIC interpreter returns into G1 mode; same behavior if an error occurs in
  direct mode while in graphic modes;
- pressing the "RUN STOP" key while in direct mode and in graphic modes leads the
  interpreter to return to G1 mode 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.6   - 20200419

- Minor improvement in LIST code (no more empty lines after a line that ends at the most right
  side of the video; listing a program from serial when the computer is in graphic 2 mode does
  not lead to a one-row-list anymore)
- fixed a bug in sound management (automatic cutting down of a sound wrongly altered the
  sound mixer);
- added management of noise by PSG;
- fixed some timing issues in VDP access that lead to graphic glitches in graphic mode 2;
- code improvements

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.5   - 20200408

- Fixed a bug into the new code of LIST statement;
- serial & BASIC buffers expanded to 88 chars;
