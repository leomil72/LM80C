                                LM80C 64K - Changelog

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following file reports the changelog of the firmware developed by Leonardo Miliani
for the LM80C 64K Color Computer. More info at www DOT leonardomiliani DOT com

P.S.: for the changelog of the LM80C Color Computer see the corresponding changelog file

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.13    - 20210316

- SAVE now can be used to change the name to a file, too;
- disk access speeded up by using OTIR & INIR statements;
- code size optimization.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.12    - 20210310

- New LM80C DOS 1.02: code size optimization; new "undelete file" feature for DISK

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.11    - 20210309

- New LM80C DOS 1.01;
- Better error managemenet for LM80C DOS routines;
- new behaviour of ERASE command (now in full erase, il also wipes out the file entry);
- code cleaning and optimization for LM80C DOS;
- code cleaning and optimization for some LM80C DOS commands.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.10    - 20210307

- New cold reset: by pressing the RUN/STOP key during the boot sequence, the computer
  restarts again and re-copy the firmware from ROM to RAM, to restore the original code
  and fix FW modifications made with POKEs w/o the need to power off the computer;
- Added support for LM80C DOS 1.0 and new commands DISK, FILES, LOAD, SAVE, ERASE.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.05    - 20210119

- Better serial management with RTS-driven chars receiveing
- Fixed a bug introduced in the previous releases that lead to chars that disappearing 
  during text printing/scrolling

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.04    - 20210105

- New behaviour for backspace (DEL) key: now chars that follow the cursor are moved 1 position
  to the left while deleting the char immediately before the current cursor position
- New behaviour for INSERT key: now it inserts a SPACE char (ASCII 32) so that the space 
  inserted is seen as part of the current line (in the past, the NULL char [ASCII 0] was used)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.03    - 20210104

- >> Important HW modification <<: MODE pin of VDP is now connected to A0, to simplify the
  coding for the video chip (just a "DEC reg" to change the VDP port)
- The change above also lead to a size reduction of the binary file
- Fixed again the cursor management routine so that the cursor is visible when being moved
- Changed the special key to disable the I/O DOS buffer, now it's CTRL
- Unified the source files between 32K and 64K versions thanks to the support for compiler's
  directives of the SJASMPlus assembler

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.02    - 20201231

- Fixed a bug into the serial code: the incoming chars were print on screen even if the
  cursor was off (i.e., in indirect mode)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.01    - 20201231

- Code revision to comply with the assembler SJASMPLUS
- Moved equates for BASIC workspace area into a separated file

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.00    - 20201229 - The 64K edition

- Hardware revision for memory expansion to 64K of RAM and bank switching mechanism to
  start in ROM, then switch to full 64K of RAM with copy of BASIC into the volatile memory
- Hardware revision to get the same bank switching mechanism for the VRAM to let the use
  of 2 portions of 16K each
- Serial buffer overrun revision
- Added key auto-repeat
- Added support for INSERT key to insert a space between text by moving the chars after the
  cursor position
- LIST now manage ending line number correctly, so that it won't list the line after the
  one passed as argument anymore
- BASIC support for serial channel B
- Code revision to comply with Z88DK assembler requirements
- Preliminary support for external mass storage (stubs for ERASE, FILES, LOAD, SAVE commands)
- Mechanism to enable/disable the 512-byte buffer for mass storage I/O operations (by
  pressing SHIFT while logo is shown on startup)
